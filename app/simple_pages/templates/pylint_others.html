                <p class="lead">
                    In Python language, Pylint is a tool to check for errors in your code. It helps to find possible
                    problems in your codebase. It also gives a quick overview about your complex python code.

                    Type pylint in the command line prompt:

                    You have to care about messages of convention, refactor, warnings, errors, fatal after running this
                    command. Some example of the messages:

                </p>
                <p class="lead">

                <h3>Pep-8</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                    Pep-8 is a style guide for Python code. It was written by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick
                    Coghlan. Fundamental principle of the Pep-8 is to improve consistency and readability of the
                    codebase in Python language. Readability is very important because a code is read much more often
                    than it is written as Guido van Rossum said. After a while after you wrote a code, you can
                    understand all of the code in a short time if you follow the Pep-8 guide.

                </p>
                <h5>How To Choose Names: </h5>
                <p class="lead">
                    While you are trying to understand a code, you have to figure out so many things by looking at the
                    name. Therefore, it is very important to give common styles to your types.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    For example: function uses a lowercase word, and words with underscores like “function,
                    my_function”. Class starts with a capital letter and continues with lowercase words.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    In addition to convention, giving descriptive names of what the object represents improves
                    readability. Instead of giving the names of “x” and “y” to represent first name and last name for
                    your variables, giving the names of “first_name” and “last_name” improves readability of the code.
                </p>
                <h5>Code Layout:</h5>
                <p class="lead">
                    * Black lines improve readability of the code.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    * PEP 8 suggests lines should be limited to 79 characters.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    * If breaking lines needs binary operation, you should put that before the operation.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    * Put 4 consecutive spaces for indentation instead of using tabs.
                </p>
                <h5>Comment and Documentation String:</h5>
                <p class="lead">
                    Putting a comment inside of your code helps you to understand the functionality of your code blocks.
                    Use “#” and single space before your explanation. By giving inline comments, be more specific
                    instead of explaining everything. Put """ before and after your explanation for multiline strings.
                </p>
                <h5>Linters and Autoformatters:</h5>
                <p class="lead">
                    Linters and autoformatters are tools to help your code to fit the complaint of Pep-8. While Linters
                    shows flag errors and stylistic problems in the code. Autoformatters reformat your code
                    automatically to fit Pep-8 compliant.
                </p>
                <h3>Pytest</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                    Pytest is a Python testing framework. This offers a huge benefit to tests since we do not need to
                    run the same code every single test. Even complex algorithms are tested effectively, while writing
                    flexible tests in a system. Python provides an important set of productivity features to optimize
                    the test.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    You can start Pytest by first creating a py module. Add a basic Python functions as the below
                    example:
                </p>
                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='webpage_images/pytest_img.png') }}"
                     class="d-block img-thumbnail rounded">
                <p class="lead">
                    I created a calculator_test.py module and wrote the test_calculator_add_method. The method is
                    testing the add() method of the Calculator class. It also shows the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert)
                    testing model which is a pattern for writing a good test.
                </p>

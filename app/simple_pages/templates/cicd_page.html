                        We are creating a commit in a branch and than We can merge it with main branch into Github, but
                        also
                        we can add a Ci/CD directly in our repository. Therefore, we are able to test our code in Github
                        before merging. We can do this because we have a .github/workflow file in our repository
                        including
                        event, job, steps, actions. event automatically triggers the workflow which contains jobs. In
                        these
                        jobs, there is test code working whenever a commit is pushed.

                    <p class="lead">
                        When master is updated you have to push your images into DockerHub. First, you must create a
                        repository and copy the tag of the repo. Then write the tag at the terminal. Your images was
                        pushed
                        to DockerHub so you can pull and run the image on your computer.

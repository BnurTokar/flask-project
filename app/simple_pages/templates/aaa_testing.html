                <p class="lead">
                    Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) is a pattern for writing good tests. In the arrange step, the test concept
                    sets up inputs and targets for the act step. Then, the act block calls methods under test along with
                    the arranged parameters. Finally, the assert step expects an outcome or response, and determines the
                    goodness of the action of the test method.

                    There are different test frameworks in Python such as Robot Framework, Nose2, Pytest. This tutorial
                    provides an example by using Pytest.

                    In the above code snippet, you can find the test code for a calculator program. Lines 20-21 and
                    Lines 30-31 demonstrate the Arrangement step by creating variables of value_1, value_2 and object of
                    calculator for testing. In line 24, you can see the action of the program calling the “add” method
                    from the Calculation class by using variables. In line 19, the Assert step comes into play and
                    checks
                    whether the result of the Act step passes or fails. Similarly, test_calculator_sub_method() function
                    processes Act and Assert steps as well.

                <h3>Why Is Testing Important ?</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                    Testing provides so many advantages for both project and developer perspectives.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Primarily, it helps developers to recognize possible errors and warnings before deploying into
                    production. On the other hand, it speeds up the process and decreases the cost of the project and
                    protects the codebase since having a hanging code in a large project can be quite expensive which
                    causes
                    damages and possibile breaking to the codebase. Moreover, the debugging process is going to be
                    simple as
                    the developer is going to recognize bugs or any problems in the system in the early stage of the
                    software development life cycle. Also it improves readability of the code by reducing the number of
                    bugs
                    occured in the code.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    To sum up, testing is important because it improves the code readability, speeds up the process,
                    decreases the cost of the project, protects the codebase and simplifies the debugging process.

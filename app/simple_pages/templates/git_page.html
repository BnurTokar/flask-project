                        Branching is essentially a new copy of your source code of the directory. While making a branch,
                        you
                        are replaying it in a new area. Restoring the messed up development might be an expensive
                        process.
                        Branches are used to protect the main line of the development. You are creating a branch and
                        working
                        on it, so you can continue to do work without messing with the main line.

                        Branches are the most important thing for Git. We need to know some operations of the branches
                        to
                        use Git. These are:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="color:BLUE"> Create Branch: </span> It is the first step of starting the process.
                        To create a new branch and check out of
                        it, you can use the code in the terminal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        git checkout -b
                        "branch-name"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="color:BLUE">Merge Branch:</span> If you are done with a branch and want to use it
                        in any other branch in your Git
                        repository. you can merge it with another one. You can merge the branches by using the following
                        code.
                    </p>
                    git checkout main
                    git merge
                    "branch-name"

                            <span style="color:BLUE">Delete a Branch: </span>If you are done with the branch and need no
                            longer, you can delete the
                            branch by using the code.
                        </p>

                            git -d

                        <p>
                            The commit command is used to save your changes on your repository. There are some
                            basic commands:
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            git commit
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            git commit -a
                            git commit -m “commit message”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tags:

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tagging the revision can be very helpful. You can easily return to the label
                            or version you specify.

                        </p>

                            A Git repository is the .git/ folder inside a project. This folder keep all changes
                            of the project. It is also a platform you can work in a team so you can follow all
                            changes your teammate made.
                        </p>
